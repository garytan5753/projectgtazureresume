This project is intended to create my porfolio/resume website. I also documented details of this project and tools I had used.

This project was intented for me to learn more on CI/CD, explore on Azure DevOps & GitHub and Azure Services such as Azure Static Web Apps.

2. I choosen using Azure DevOps Repo to to keep my project files due to my working nature use it and I will like to get a better understanding & experience on using it.
3. Due to unavaible to make it to public like how GitHub able, I sync it to my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/garytan5753/projectgtazureresume).
4. So any update will be push to Azure DevOps Repo and Pipeline will start to work to update on my website. I manually run a tool to sync my Azure DevOps Repo to my GitHub Repo.
